    <h1 align="center">welcome to my website's home page</h1>
    <p align="justify">Many briefs forget to include background information on the business or organisation. While it is
        useful to include links to any existing offline / online marketing collateral, a quick overview of your
        organisation is immensely helpful at the briefing stage.</p>

    <p>Start your brief with information like:

        <ul>
            <li>When was your organisation established? Where do you operate? What are the main products or
                services you offer?</li>
            <li>Tell us about your DNA. What are you known for? What is your vision and mission? How do you
                differentiate yourself from your competitors?
            </li>
            <li>What is the main message that you wish your website to convey? (If you have an existing content
                strategy, please include your key messaging from that strategy here.)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
