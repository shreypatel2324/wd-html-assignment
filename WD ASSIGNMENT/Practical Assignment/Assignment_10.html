            <h1>Ahmedabad Plain Crash </h1>
            <p>An Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
                International Airport in Ahmedabad on Thursday afternoon, killing 274 people: 241 passengers, 33
                on-ground deaths.
                The aircraft, bound for London, plunged into the Meghani area of the city, sending up a massive plume of
                black smoke and triggering an immediate emergency response.
                According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), there were 242 people on board the
                aircraft — 230 passengers, 2 pilots, and 10 cabin crew members.</p>
